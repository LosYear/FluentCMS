Для разметки изображения плоскостями при-меняется подход на основе минимального покрывающего дерева.

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Наиболее значимыми факторами, оказывающими негативное влияние на восприятие видеоинформации, являются неравномерность освещения наблюдаемой сцены, погодные условия и дрожание камеры. Предлагаемая система предусматривает возможность улучшения качества видеопотока при помощи временных и пространственных методов. Для осуществления компенсации дрожания кадра предложен метод стабилизации видеопоследовательности, основанный на методе соответствия блоков с учетом пространственно-временной постобработки. В методе предусмотрен выбор предустановленных зон изображения, что позволяет повысить эффективность алгоритма при отсутствии движения камеры. Для оповещения оператора о происходящих в зоне наблюдения событиях предложен метод разделения движения на три уровня. Авторами предлагается нелинейное улучшение изображений с сохранением локального контраста в плохо и ярко освещенных областях. Применение нелинейной коррекции изображения позволяет повысить качество наблюдаемой сцены в вечернее время суток и при плохих погодных условиях. Представлены результаты экспериментов для детектора движения. Приведены данные об эффективности стабилизации и о повышении визуального качества изображений, полученных в сложных условиях освещения.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Наиболее значимыми факторами, оказывающими негативное влияние на восприятие видеоинформации, являются неравномерность освещения наблюдаемой сцены, погодные условия и дрожание камеры. Предлагаемая система предусматривает возможность улучшения качества видеопотока при помощи временных и пространственных методов. Для осуществления компенсации дрожания кадра предложен метод стабилизации видеопоследовательности, основанный на методе соответствия блоков с учетом пространственно-временной постобработки. В методе предусмотрен выбор предустановленных зон изображения, что позволяет повысить эффективность алгоритма при отсутствии движения камеры. Для оповещения оператора о происходящих в зоне наблюдения событиях предложен метод разделения движения на три уровня. Авторами предлагается нелинейное улучшение изображений с сохранением локального контраста в плохо и ярко освещенных областях. Применение нелинейной коррекции изображения позволяет повысить качество наблюдаемой сцены в вечернее время суток и при плохих погодных условиях. Представлены результаты экспериментов для детектора движения. Приведены данные об эффективности стабилизации и о повышении визуального качества изображений, полученных в сложных условиях освещения.</p>

Идея предложенного алгоритма заключается в использовании множества контрольных точек для вычисления набора плоскостей, аппроксимирующих сцену, и последующем присво-ении каждому пикселю изображения оптимальной плоскости. Для разметки изображения плоскостями при-меняется подход на основе минимального покрывающего дерева. Приводятся результаты эксперименталь-ной оценки предложенного алгоритма на опубликованной в 2012 году тестовой базе KITTI, содержащей изображения наземной городской съемки.</p>

Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>

Прослеживая развитие системы образования от истоков до наших дней, отмечается ведущая роль учителя. Снижение его статуса в наши дни является главной проблемой образования. Общество, в котором учитель &ndash; это лицо, предоставляющее образовательные услуги, не имеет будущего. Где найти достойных учителей для миллионов студентов?</p>

<p>Один из предлагаемых выходов состоит в использовании информационных технологий (ИТ). Учебный курс, подготовленный с использованием ИТ и выложенный в Интернет, может быть куда интереснее печатного учебника. Практика интернет-курсов пока не стала частью официальной системы университетского образования, но ситуация должна измениться. В ближайшие годы часть курсов, изучаемых студентами университета, несомненно будет представлена интернет-курсами. Это позволит существенно повысить качество обучения, уменьшив потребность в высококлассных преподавателях.</p>

<p>Другой выход видится в более тесных связях факультетов, готовящих ИТ-специалистов, и ИТ-индустрии. В укреплении этих связей большую роль играет АП КИТ &ndash; Ассоциация Предприятий Компьютерных и Информационных Технологий.</p>
